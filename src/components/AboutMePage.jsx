                My name is Rimas and I am a software developer looking to start my career in the tech industry. I
am passionate about technology and want to work on interesting projects that affect the world in a
meaningful way.

                I have a Masters degree in Electronic Engineering with core Computer Engineer modules,
completed at University of York. Here I was introduced into the world of software development and
found my passion. I learned the core principles of software development with various programming
languages like Java, C and Python. During my studies I gained: excellent problem solving skills,
good report writing skills, experience in efficient teamwork and communication.
I have participated in multiple software development projects, on an academic and personal level,
where I was involved in all stages of product development. The projects I worked on ranged from a
simple Snake game to more advanced projects such as evolutionary algorithms and robotics.

                The most notable project I undertook was building a fictional company and delivering a software
solution for a “client”. This 6 month exercise involved speaking with the “client” to understand
their needs, capturing the requirements, designing the product, planing out the development stage
and adapting to changes in circumstances such as Covid lockdowns.

                <p className="paragraph">
                Most recently I have completed a software development boot-camp that expanded my knowledge
and taught me new skills in full-stack web and mobile development. I gained a deeper
understanding of SDLC, its various methodologies, including agile, SOLID, TDD and software
development on Linux OS.
